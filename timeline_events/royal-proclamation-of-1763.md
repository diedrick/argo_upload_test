name: Royal Proclamation of 1763
era: imperial-crisis
start_date: 1763-10-07
notes: On the heels of the Treaty of Paris some months earlier, the Royal
  Proclamation announced the creation of two new colonies on mainland North
  America—East and West Florida—and laid out new governments for the British
  Ceded Islands, Quebec, the Floridas, and Nova Scotia. Most controversially, the
  proclamation anncounced a new border, generally known as the Proclamation Line,
  that would run down the Appalachian Mountains, and forbade new Euramerican
  settlements beyond it, an effort to prevent further warfare with Indigenous
  peoples and keep Europeans settlers close to the coasts.
