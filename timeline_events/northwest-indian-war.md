  While the British ceded lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the
  Mississippi to the United States in 1783, they did not consult the Native
  inhabitants of the region. As Anglo-American settlers and state actors expanded
  into the region, Indigenous Nations pushed back in a series of armed conflicts
  which included some of the worst defeats ever suffered by the United States
  army, although the United States was ultimately able to militarily dominate the
  region.
