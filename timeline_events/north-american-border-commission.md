name: North American Border Commission
era: early-republic-and-loyalism
start_date: 1797-01-01
notes: > 
  In the wake of the Jay Treaty, commissioners representing the United States and
  the remianing British colonies descend Passamquoddy Bay between what is now the
  state of Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick to determine the exact
  location of the international border. At issue was which of the rivers emptying
  to the bay was the historic St. Croix river. Relying on Indigenous testimony,
  seventeenth-century French documentation, and amateur archaeological digs, the
  issue is ultimately decided in favor of the British position, creating the
  modern US-Canada border. This commission, the first to determine issues of
  territorial extent using binding arbitration, set a diplomatic precendent still
  influential today.
