name: Battle of Cartagena de Indias
era: growing-tensions
start_date: 1741-03-13
end_date: 1741-05-20
notes: > 
  After two previous efforts to sieze the Spanish port (modern day Cartagena,
  Colombia) failed, Admiral Vernon launched a third effort in spring of 1741 as a
  combined land and naval assault. However, the end result was a disaster, as a
  combination of military failures and raging yellow fever decimated British
  forces and served only to reinforce Spanish supremacy in the region.
