notes: > 
  Louisbourg was a French fortress perched in a strategic position controlling
  access to the Gulf of St Lawrence and widely understood the be the "key" to
  French control of both the region and access to its larger settlements in
  Quebec. While popularly considered impregnable, it was seized during King
  George's War by a force largely organized by New Englanders with support from a
  British Naval fleet. A major propaganda victory for colonists, it was marred by
  camp fever which raged through the garrison and further undermined when the fort
  was returned to the French in 1748.
