name: Shays' Rebellion
era: early-republic-and-loyalism
start_date: 1786-08-29
end_date: 1787-02-01
notes: Protests against the economic and political policies of the new United
  States errupted into a armed rebellion in western Massachusetts under
  Revolutionary war veteran Daniel Shays. This event is considered to be a
  contributing cause to the widespred sense that a new frame of
  government—perhaps with a stronger federal component—was needed to replace
  the Articles of Confederation.
