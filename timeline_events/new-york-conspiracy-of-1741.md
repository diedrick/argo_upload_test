name: New York Conspiracy of 1741
era: growing-tensions
start_date: 1741-01-01
notes: A purported plot by enslaved people and poor whites to burn down New York
  City. While it is unclear if any such plot actually existed, the reaction was
  swift and brutal: 172 people were arrested, 84 were transported to the Caribbean
  and 34 were executed by hanging and burning at the stake. While white men and
  women were among those arrested and executed, the majority of those put to death
  were Black men.
