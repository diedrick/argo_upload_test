name: Pointe Coupée Slave Conspiracy, 1795
era: early-republic-and-loyalism
start_date: 1795-04-01
notes: Inspired by the Haitian Revolution, enslaved people in Pointe Coupée
  Parish, Louisiana once again attempt an uprising against their enslavers.
  Betrayed to Spanish officials, the ensuing trial saw 57 enslaved people and
  three whites convicted. 23 enslaved people were executed and had their heads
  displayed on pikes along the Mississippi River in a blunt display of official
  power and terror.
