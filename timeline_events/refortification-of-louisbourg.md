name: Refortification of Louisbourg
era: growing-tensions
start_date: 1748-01-01
notes: Louisbourg was captured by a force of New Englanders in 1745, but
  returned to the French after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Largely dismantled
  by the British, the French now undertook an ambitious (and never fully realized)
  refortification effort, signalling their renewed interest in the region.
