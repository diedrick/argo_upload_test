name: Foundation of Halifax
era: growing-tensions
start_date: 1749-06-21
notes: Under the direct orders of the British Parliament, the colony of Nova
  Scotia is given a civil government for the first time and a new captial,
  Halifax, is founded on the Atlantic shore. Although the British had claimed the
  region since 1710, there had been almost no practical British presence on the
  ground. This action contributed to growing tensions with the French (who still
  claimed much of the region) as well as the Indigenous nations of the area.
