  out from Fort Cumberland with the goal of capturing Fort Duquesne. The force
  spent a great deal of time cutting a road through the dense forest land and was

  Monongahela on 9 Jul. Braddock was roundly defeated and suffered massive losses,
  and he himself died of his wounds during the retreat on 13 Jul.
