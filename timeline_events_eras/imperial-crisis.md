At the end of the Seven Years' War, the British empire in North America had grown to include the entire North American continent east of the Mississippi River. This massive expansion, as well as the many victories of the war and unprecedented levels of colonial-imperial cooperation, initially resulted in a period of trans-Atlantic good feeling and pride.

Angered by British dismissal and ill-treatment,&nbsp;Native peoples living in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region rose up before the ink of the global peace treaty was dry.

Meanwhile, the French and Spanish faced their own period of imperial realignment and reform.
