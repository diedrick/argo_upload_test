name: Townshend Acts
era: imperial-crisis
start_date: 1767-06-05
end_date: 1768-07-06
notes: Despite the spectacular failure of the Stamp Act, British Parliament
  continued to try and find a way to successfully tax the colonies. The Townshend
  Acts introduced new duties on glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea, stridently
  insisted on the rights of Parliament to tax its American colonies, and
  introduced new enforcement mechanisms.
