name: Dunmore's Proclamation
era: american-revolution
start_date: 1775-11-07
notes: > 
  As the American Revolution began to rage, Virginia governor John Murray, 4th
  Earl of Dunmore, announced that any enslaved persons who ran away from their
  enslavers and joined the British cause would recieve their freedom. Dunmore was
  no abolitionist, and the proclamation was meant as an attack on rebel property
  and morale; however, it led directly to the freedom of many formerly enslaved
  people and set a precedent that was later expanded to all colonies later in the
  war.
