name: Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
era: growing-tensions
start_date: 1748-04-24
notes: This treaty formally ended the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748,
  also known as King George's War in North America) between the British and
  French; however, it left underlying tensions unresolved, and most observers
  believed that another war was simply a matter of when, not if.
