American independence was recognized by the British in 1783, once again transforming the political realities of North America. The new United States began the long and often difficult process of determining how the nation should be governed and who it should be governed by. The remaining British territories were flooded by thousands of Loyalist refugees, who also sought to find a new way to live within what they hoped would be a revitalized British Empire. Native peoples, meanwhile, faced a new era of painful challenges, as many nations were forced to accept treaties giving up their lands and faced unprecedented numbers of new settlers arriving in their homelands as the line of European settlement expanded&nbsp;aggressively to the west.
