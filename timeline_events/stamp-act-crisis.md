notes: > 
  As part of efforts to raise revenue in the colonies in the wake of the Seven
  Years' War, the Stamp Act introduced a tax on paper products in the colonies
  (the stamp acting as proof that the tax had been paid). Seen as an overstep of
  imperial authority, the act provoked violent and widespread resistence in most
  American mainland colonies. Though eventually repealled, Parliament continued to
  claim the right to directly tax and govern colonists.]
