While the previous years had seen their fair share of inter-imperial conflict, it was nothing in comparison to the massive global conflagration that erupted in the American woods in 1754. In late spring of that year, a very young and inexperienced George Washington wandered into a powder keg on what should have been a routine diplomatic mission protesting the construction of a series of new French forts on the Ohio River. When the smoke cleared, a French officer was dead, and war quickly followed. In 1756 the war spread to Europe and Asia, the first time such a conflict had been initiated in the colonies. After a string of early losses, the British and their Indigenous allies turned the tide in a series of remarkable victories in 1759, which soon became known as the&nbsp;_Annus Mirabilis&nbsp;_and culminated in the capture of the French colonial capital at Qu&eacute;bec. The Treaty of Paris, signed in early 1763, confirmed the loss of&nbsp;entire French mainland North American empire. All former French claims east of the Mississippi were ceded to the British, with the western territory of Louisiana transferred to the Spanish.
