The North American colonies of Spain, France, and Britain enjoyed a period of inter-imperial peace lasting from the end of Queen Anne's War in 1713 until 1739. In that year, a conflict colorfully known as the War of Jenkin's Ear&nbsp;broke out between Britain and Spain. This war was&nbsp;followed quickly by King George's War, the American theater of the European War of the Austrian Succession, which brough the French in on the side of the Spanish. Both conflicts concluded in 1748 with an uneasy peace which few observers thought would last. They were correct. This era was marked by rising tensions, military escalation, and fort building as the global superpowers of the age jockeyed for supremacy. Native nations found themselves increasingly forced to choose a side as neutrality became politically untenable.&nbsp;
